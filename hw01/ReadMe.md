This project was created in Java 8 using Maven to manage build dependencies.  For terminal graphics, the project uses an ncurses like Java framework called Lanterna, found here: https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna/  

The Etch-A-Sketch program was created in Intelli J Idea, and can be opened in the studio and a .jar file built.  Once the .jar file is built, it can be ran using "java -jar file.jar".  Note that the Bone must have Java installed from apt-get.

Here is a short video of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql88NeDYAs0


1)  I have installed the latest shipped version on the Bone using the SdCard

2)  I plan to order or make labels for the bone, not a high priority

3)  I have an Arch Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox ready and operational for kernel development

4)  I have an HDMI cable for the bone, all USB cables, power cables, and have three 16GB sdcards

5)  I have Git

6)  I signed up for the Google Groups a while ago

7)  Wrote the Etch-A-Sketch program found here

Comments from Prof. Yoder
Could you build the .jar for me?
apt-get install java doesn't work on my bone.  What should I do?

Nice video.

Grade:  8/10
I'll give you more points once I get java install and you get me the .jar file.

Looks like a great start.

use apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
to install Java 8.
