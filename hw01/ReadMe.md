This project was created in Java 8 using Maven to manage build dependencies.  For terminal graphics, the project uses an ncurses like Java framework called Lanterna, found here: https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna/  

The Etch-A-Sketch program was created in Intelli J Idea, and can be opened in the studio and a .jar file built.  Once the .jar file is built, it can be ran using "java -jar file.jar".  Note that the Bone must have Java installed from apt-get.

Here is a short video of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql88NeDYAs0
