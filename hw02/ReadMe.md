This project was created in Javascript using the Bonescript node.js library.

This project currently is not complete,

hw02a.js will use interrupts and allows 4 LEDs to light up when a corresponding button is held down.

The hw02b folder contains the EtchASketch program modified to use four push button switches to control inputs.  The program is based off of hw01 and therefore is written in Java.

This project was created in Java 8 using Maven to manage build dependencies. For terminal graphics, the project uses an ncurses like Java framework called Lanterna, found here: https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna/

For GPIO control on the BBB, the project uses a Java library called BullDog: https://github.com/SilverThings/bulldog

The Etch-A-Sketch program was created in Intelli J Idea, and can be opened in the studio and a .jar file built. Once the .jar file is built, it can be ran using "java -jar file.jar". Note that the Bone must have Java installed from apt-get.

It works!  Was javeScript easier to use?
